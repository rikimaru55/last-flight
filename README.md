TODO:
- Add ship and controls
- Use radar to spot hidden ship
- Using the radar costs time and fuel.
- Short range radar is very fast, and costs little, but has very short range.
- Long Range Rader is slow, costs more, but has a very long range.
- Each shot takes time to reload.
- If the timer runs out, you lose.
- If you run into the enemy shields you die.
- If you manage to hit the hidden ship you win.
Bonus:
- Different types of ammo that take a different amount of time to prepare
- As the timer runs our your crew panics and we can show panic messages.
- Hidden ship has more than one life.
Future:
- AI that fires back
- Online Multiplayer!
